A simple script that i made to clean up my download folder but obviously can be used for any other folder you'd like to use it on.

To run:
1. Update 'folderPath' to directory of your using
2. run 'python SortdownloadScript.py' (make sure you're in the correct directory)

If you'd like to use change folder names or add new folders you can by updating the 'folders' array, then updating the file move loops.
